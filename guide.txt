This is a guide for the Monopoly game Api

For every call we get the GameDO updated record in JSON format.

To Create a new game, we need to send http://localhost:8080/api/create-game
This URL will reset the old game if available and create a new game.

Response - {"id":84,"pOnePoints":1000,"pTwoPoints":1000,"pOnePos":"START","pTwoPos":"START","startCrossed":false}

To resume an old game, we need to send http://localhost:8080/api/resume-game
This URL will get last played game and resume the play.
Note: I have given a column called lastPlayedBy. This will help up to know which player is to play next.

Once the game is started, we need to call the roll-dice api with the player as a parameter
"http://localhost:8080/api/roll-die/p1" or "http://localhost:8080/api/roll-die/p2"

Once this URL is provoked, we take a random dice number in Java and play the game.

If a player is placed on an unowned place, then it will buy the place and subtract the amount from the player.
Response:
{"id":84,"pOnePoints":1000.00,"pTwoPoints":1240.00,"pOnePos":"KCS","pTwoPos":"KCS","pOneProperties":"KCS","pTwoProperties":"TAL$OKT","lastPlayedBy":"p1","turnNumber":5,"startCrossed":true,"rentOrBuyMessage":"You landed on King Cross station ","diceNumber":11}

If the player is placed on the other player's place, then rent will be paid from this user.

If a player crosses START then $200 is added to his points.

If a player's points is less than 0 then he will be declared as Loser

If game continues before 50th turn, we will check the highest amount holder and announce him as the winner.
